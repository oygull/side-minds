            Over the last 10 years marketing has gone through a seismic shift, with responsibility changing by over 50%1
            and expectations and demands skyrocketing. Marketing channels and customer journeys have expanded, data
            sources and technology advanced, and the need for innovation continuously grows. A dramatic changes which
            has created a plethora of new roles like Chief Digital Officer, Chief Customer Officer and Chief Growth
            Officer, a diversification you don’t see in any other leadership role.
          </p>
          <p class="services-modal-body-right-desc">
            Change at this level means the role can be less understood by the leadership team, creating confusion,
            frustration and delay. No wonder the marketing leader is the last trusted2 member of the executive team and
            the shortest tenure at just over 2 years3.
          </p>
          <p class="services-modal-body-right-desc">
            This is a terrible waste of time and effort for everyone involved.

            optimise effectiveness. When needed, Sideminds can also introduce external advisers or NEDs from its unique

            Marketing is a wide and diverse field of skills and as you navigate your way to the leadership role it is
            important to grow your skillset and understand the breadth of opportunities available. As you become more
            experienced in one area of marketing, it becomes increasingly difficult to switch into another. This is why
            when it comes to senior marketing recruitment candidates are often either predominately a brand or digital
            background and it’s a risk putting them into roles encompassing both.

            strategic moves upwards and sometimes sideways and developed the critical experience to succeed as a leader.

          Sideminds helps marketing leaders excel through coaching, advising, mentoring and in some instances, delivery
          of key marketing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sideminds’ approach unlocks the marketer’s potential by helping them improve their ability in six key
          success areas called ANCHOR Factors, where ANCHOR is an acronym for 6 pairs of essential marketing leadership
          capabilities and behaviours. The 6 areas were defined after studying the behaviours of senior marketers and
          understanding what made some successful and others not.

            Exceptional marketing leaders are more than just great marketers, they are the ultimate bridge between the

            opportunities whilst delivering results today, and constantly ensuring key decision makers are informed and

            Success in role is far less about functional capability, but the ability to lead, shape opinions, get
